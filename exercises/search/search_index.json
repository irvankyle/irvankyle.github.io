Follow the steps in Exercise 1 to access Appian Community Edition, and then deploy the Order Management (OM) application from the app catalog. How Can I Practice? You should practice in Appian Community Edition. This free, community Appian resource comes with the ability to deploy pre-built Appian applications. Keep in mind that this is a community environment not suitable for production workloads or sensitive information. Appian Version Appian Community Edition is on the latest Appian version. If you are following the exercises from a previous Appian version, go to academy.appian.com to download the latest version. Naming Conventions When you register for Appian Community Edition, you gain access to a workspace, which is your personal area within the community environment. When your workspace has been assigned, you will receive a confirmation email with a workspace ID. Pre-loaded apps in your workspace include the workspace ID. Use this workspace ID when creating new applications and objects. Otherwise, you could run into naming conflicts with objects created by other users. In the example below, the application prefix for the Acme Auto Solution app is W0000AS. So, the workspace ID is W0000, which would be included in any new app's prefix. App Catalog The App Catalog contains the most recent versions of pre-built apps available in Appian Community Edition. To go to the App Catalog, on Community Edition Home, click BROWSE APP CATALOG . To determine if you have the latest app version, select the app in the list and review the last updated date. If this date is later than when you registered for Appian Community Edition, you should deploy a new version. If you recently received your workspace, you likely have the latest versions. Save Often Appian does not automatically save updates, so save your objects frequently. Additional Resources Appian provides a number of training resources for Appian developers. The following resources are particularly popular with our learners: Academy Online - Appian's online courses provide useful survey courses, step-by-step tutorials, and practice exercises.

Exercise 2: Add a Process in Process Insights Role: Data Steward Scenario Next Gen wants to investigate their order fulfillment process to identify the cause of a recent increase in the average order fulfillment duration. To enable this analysis, you \u2014 a data steward with the permission for handling the order-related record types in Process HQ \u2014 will set up a process in the Process Insights page. First, you\u2019ll identify the correct record types and will use them to add a process to the Process Insights page. Then you\u2019ll configure process security to make this process available for analysis by qualified business analysts. Log into Appian Community Edition and access Process HQ from the navigation menu. Click to open the Process Insights page. Click the + ADD PROCESS button in the right-hand corner. Select the Order Submissions record type, and click NEXT . Select the Order Submission Events record type, and click NEXT . Next, Appian allows you to select or deselect the fields from the case and event history record types based on what attributes you want to make available to analysts in Process HQ. You can also create custom attributes to refine your existing data. In this exercise, you\u2019ll group order prices into three buckets: low, medium, and high. In the Configure Case Data step, click ADD CUSTOM ATTRIBUTE. In the Create Custom Attribute dialog, select Groups Based on a Range , and click NEXT . Apply the following configurations: In the Create Groups From field, select Price . In the Number of Groups field, click the + icon to add a third group. In the Custom Attribute Value fields, enter the following values: Low includes values \u2264 2000. Medium includes values >2000 and \u2264 6000. High includes any remaining values. Click TEST to preview the values, then NEXT . Enter attribute properties: Name : Enter Price Group . Description : Enter Low: Price \u2264 2000, Medium: 2000 &lt; Price \u2264 6000, High: 6000 &lt; Price . Click CREATE . Deselect the Price field, then click NEXT . The Price field is replaced by the Price Group attribute you just created. In the Configure Event Data step, deselect the following fields: Id from the Order Submission Events record type Event Type Id from the Order Submission Events record type Id from the Order Submission Event Type record type These fields are not useful to the analyst and do not need to be included in the process. Click MAP ATTRIBUTES . Review what each field is mapped to, and then update field mapping as follows: End Time field: Select End . The Map Attributes screen is also where you can rename attributes. This may be necessary if you have attributes from different record types that have conflicting names. Click OK, then NEXT . Configure process properties and security: Name : Enter Order Submissions (First Name Last Name) . In order to avoid naming conflicts with other users in Appian Community Edition, append your first and last name to the name of the process. Description : Enter A process for the fulfillment of submitted orders . Process Security : Verify that your user is the analyst for the process. You can click Add Users or Groups to add additional analysts or viewers for this process. Update Options : Leave the default settings. These settings control when Process HQ will check for new data in the associated record types and reevaluate process metrics. Click ADD PROCESS . Tip You\u2019re done with adding a new process to the Process Insights page. It may take a few minutes to complete the process creation before it becomes available for analysis. Click the refresh button to see the updated status. **Congratulations! ** You just set up a process in process insights, and made it available for analysis.

( Back to top )( Next alert ) >>>>> Spend a few minutes on the SUMMARY tab reviewing the high-level generated discoveries, so that you can understand your process better before you dig deeper. As a business analyst, here you can accomplish the following: Review the default KPIs. Review the process diagram to see how the process runs in practice. Review the available case attributes. Review the default chart that reflects the change in volume and duration over time. Adjust the timeframe for displayed data. Try to answer the following questions? Look at the process diagram. Which activities, if any, appear to be slowing down the process? Which sequence in the process takes the longest? Look at the chart at the bottom of the SUMMARY tab. What happens to case duration as the number of cases increases? Start an Investigation An investigation is a guided experience that allows business analysts to uncover what attributes or sequences contribute the most to a specific performance issue (for example, a longer case duration).

Include as many findings as you need to provide the right level of detail for your use case. In this exercise, you added two findings. However, a business analyst could continue with the investigation by looking at additional attributes in the process. **Congratulations! ** **You just saved an investigation with a new and valuable insight. You or other analysts can add more insights to this investigation later. ** Create a View The investigation in the previous step revealed a bottleneck involving repeated work with the shipping vendor Pioneer Solutions. Following this investigation, analysts were able to look deeper into affected processes and determine that errors in manual data entry are causing the delays. With this issue addressed, you will now create a view for your process. Views show metrics for a filtered subset of your process data. In this case, you\u2019ll create a view that allows you to monitor cases involving Pioneer Solutions to assess performance in the future. Navigate to the SUMMARY tab. If the SUMMARY tab is not visible, you may need to navigate back to your process using the breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

However, there will be times when you want to create custom KPIs that reflect your own understanding of a business process. In this exercise, you\u2019ll build a custom KPI to monitor the duration of the Notified the Shipping Vendor Activity and add it to the view created in the previous step. Tracking this KPI over time allows you to see at a glance if the issue at Pioneer Solutions is being appropriately addressed.
