		'problem': 	"<p>Customers valued in-person workshops for the hands-on, practical exercises.</p><p>These exercises required specialized hardware and software configurations.</p><p>The hardware requirements, along with associated shipping and travel costs, made the workshops cost-prohibitive for smaller customers and led to long lead times in scheduling.</p>",
		'solution': "<p>Virtualize the required hardware and host it in the cloud.</p><p>Lecture sections of the workshop are delivered via video conferencing software.</p><p>Students can perform the same exercises as the existing workshops in the virtual system through a web-browser.</p>",
		'process': "<p>The workshops offered for our hardware and software products often received very positive reviews from attendees. One of the most common comments was that the hands-on exercises on the software were incredibly valuable, as the students were able to perform tasks in the same manner that they would need to in their jobs.</p><p>The downside to the workshops is that they relied on specific hardware. For a given workshop, there might be up to four separate machines, each configured differently to allow he students to gain practice on the full range of systems they are likely to encounter. The hardware led to a number of costs:</p><p>If the workshop was offered at our headquarters, customers had to bear travel and expense costs to send students.</p><p>It the workshop was offered at the customer site, equipment had to be packed and shipped, and the instructor incurred travel and expense costs.</p><p>In either case, the hardware occasionally required maintenance or replacement as it got damaged or became outdated.</p><p>These costs meant that workshops were often cost-prohibitive for smaller customers. And the long lead time for shipping and setup meant that we could not offer the workshops on short notice, or very frequently through the year.</p><p>We needed a solution that could cut costs and reduce lead time while still maintaining the practical value our customers had come to expect.</p>"
