	'about': "<p>Hi! I'm Kyle, an Instructional Designer based in North Carolina. </p><p>I’ve been building digital learning solutions for enterprise software and hardware products for over eight years. I started as a high school teacher, getting my BS in physics and my teacher’s certification from Michigan State University. After a year of teaching physics and geometry, I got the opportunity to travel to Japan, where I worked as a teacher of English as a foreign language for two years. After returning to the US in 2012, my passion for learning led me away from classroom instruction and toward digital learning. </p><p>I’ve since worked on eLearning courses, job aids, and ILT materials for a large global technology company. My learning solutions have helped internal audiences, customers, and business partners perform in their roles more successfully. Whether they are sales representatives, technical integrators, or end users, learners have benefited from the courses I’ve created. </p><p>My toolbox consists of course authoring tools like Articulate Storyline, design and prototype tools, video editing skills, and LMS administration. I’m also always interested in developing new skills to further my ability to help learners succeed in their roles, like the use of VR/AR, mobile app development, and xAPI. </p><p>Feel free to <a href=contact.html>get in touch</a> with me to talk more. </p>",
